## The Ancient Writings #1

### Description

> Before starting a new day of work on a mind-boggling programming challenge Dr XX insisted on doing her morning Yoga exercises to escape the quotidian limitation of linear control flow and embrace program counters flying through multiple dimensions with exotic topologies. Esoteric interests had always been key in the life of Dr XX, whether it was in programming languages, coffee beans or yoga excercises. 
> 
> Finding Dr XX lying dead in her working room was not what Mr Blache, her cleaning man, expected to find on this sunny spring morning.
> Unfortunately the only hint the police could find was a printout of some sort with "The answer to life, the universe and everything" scribbled on it.
> 
> Now the police is asking for your help in making sense of what is on this paper. Glancing over it, your expert eyes immediately conclude that this is a snippet of code written in a very old language.
> 
> Examing and running this code should give you all the info you need.
